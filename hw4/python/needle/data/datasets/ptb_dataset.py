def batchify(data, batch_size, device, dtype):

    Starting from sequential data, batchify arranges the dataset into columns.
    For instance, with the alphabet as the sequence and batch size 4, we'd get
    ┌ a g m s ┐
    │ b h n t │
    │ c i o u │
    │ d j p v │
    │ e k q w │
    └ f l r x ┘.
    These columns are treated as independent by the model, which means that the
    dependence of e. g. 'g' on 'f' cannot be learned, but allows more efficient
    batch processing.
    If the data cannot be evenly divided by the batch size, trim off the remainder.
    Returns the data as a numpy array of shape (nbatch, batch_size).

    get_batch subdivides the source data into chunks of length bptt.
    If source is equal to the example output of the batchify function, with
    a bptt-limit of 2, we'd get the following two Variables for i = 0:
    ┌ a g m s ┐ ┌ b h n t ┐
    └ b h n t ┘ └ c i o u ┘
    Note that despite the name of the function, the subdivison of data is not
    done along the batch dimension (i.e. dimension 1), since that was handled
    by the batchify function. The chunks are along dimension 0, corresponding
    to the seq_len dimension in the LSTM or RNN.
    Inputs:
    batches - numpy array returned from batchify function
    i - index
    bptt - Sequence length
